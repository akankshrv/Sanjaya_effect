Developed a project called "Vision Up; Virtual Voice Assistant" which aims to develop smart glasses software that detect objects in real-time and provide audio feedback to aid the visually impaired. Using YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm and other machine learning techniques, the project captures video from a camera mounted on the spectacles and processes it to identify objects in the user's surroundings. The system then provides audio feedback to the user.
